      <p>Our video content will show how to begin an productive, engaging, and motivating studying habit.
        It will also feature habits to start and to quite to be able to achieve a specific goal in studying.

        The content we have chosen would be a great help for many students not just who are struggling with their education, but also to those who wants to excell more in their education.
        <br> <br>
        Due to the uprising cases of Covid-19, most countries changed their education system into online class, modular class, or home-school as their system of learning.
        And just as the World Economic Forum has stated the education of many has dramatically changed.
        As a result, many was not and is not able to cope up with the new learning sysytem, that is why we have created this video.

      <p>Like all sorts of entertainment, specifically vlogs, there will always be target audience.
        Our target audience are the students.
        There is a wide range of students but we targeted the middle schoolers (9-12 yrs old),
        high school students and college students (13-23 yrs old).
        As we conducted research about people who have the same issues or problem traits when it comes to productivity adults (24-35 yrs old) that are
        the ones who have the same issues.
        Even though we have our target audience, our vlog or Youtube content won't be limited for these groups of people.
        The vlog will be a video friendly to all.

        <h3>Testimony</h3>
        <p>In creating this channel, we have passed through many trials and not many passed. We had problems with uploading our videos, findi a great topic for the channel, and especially with the team work. Being able to upload not only one, but two videos, shows that we are capable of doing and producing contents not only due to prior needs, but for better and greater reason. From the start of our journey, brainstorming for our name, our contents, and our line ups, we saw how much we have grown and adapted to the channel and content creating. We hope that many more will watch our videos and will learn from us. We will continue producing contents that are friendly for all and we will make sure that you will be looking forward to our future videos.</p>
